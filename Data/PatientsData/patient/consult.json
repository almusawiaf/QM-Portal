  "assessment": "Mr. S is a 70-year-old gentleman with unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer, stage group IIC, cT1cN0M0, GS 4+3, involving 2 of 12 cores, PSA 13.1. \n\nHe is not a good surgical candidate, per the Urology service.  I discussed with Mr. S management options for prostate cancer in general, including active surveillance, brachytherapy monotherapy, and external beam radiation +/- ADT.  I do not recommend active surveillance given the presence of unfavorable intermediate risk disease in the setting of excellent functional status and good life expectancy.  I do not recommend brachytherapy monotherapy as coverage may not be adequate with that modality given his extent of disease.  I recommended definitive treatment with combined radiotherapy and ADT, which is an appropriate treatment for unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer per the NCCN guidelines.  We discussed that the intent of treatment is for cure, though a cure is not guaranteed given chance of incomplete response or recurrent disease after treatment.  I had an extensive discussion with the patient regarding diagnosis and prognosis.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to radiotherapy were discussed in detail.  We had a discussion about what to expect during treatment, including logistics and potential side effects.  Management options for potential side effects were discussed.  The patient was also assessed for additional educational needs, literature on radiation therapy was provided, and all questions were answered.  He is interested in proceeding with radiotherapy. \n",

I discussed with Mr. S management options for prostate cancer in general, including active surveillance, brachytherapy monotherapy, and external beam radiation +/- ADT.  I do not recommend active surveillance given the presence of unfavorable intermediate risk disease in the setting of excellent functional status and good life expectancy.  I do not recommend brachytherapy monotherapy as coverage may not be adequate with that modality given his extent of disease.  I recommended definitive treatment with combined radiotherapy and ADT, which is an appropriate treatment for unfavorable intermediate risk prostate cancer per the NCCN guidelines.  We discussed that the intent of treatment is for cure, though a cure is not guaranteed given chance of incomplete response or recurrent disease after treatment.  I had an extensive discussion with the patient regarding diagnosis and prognosis.  The risks, benefits, and alternatives to radiotherapy were discussed in detail.  We had a discussion about what to expect during treatment, including logistics and potential side effects.  Management options for potential side effects were discussed.  The patient was also assessed for additional educational needs, literature on radiation therapy was provided, and all questions were answered.  He is interested in proceeding with radiotherapy. \n\n\nPlan of Care\n\nWe discussed the natural history of prostate cancer, and the options for management, including Definitive,Adjuvant,\n\n\nClinical Trials\n\nClinical Trial Patient: No\n\nNext Steps\n\nNext Steps:CT simulation and Radiation Treatment planning, Fiducial marker placement, Further Workup, PSA monitoring only (watchful waiting), Active Surveillance, Referral to Urology, Referral to Medical Oncology, Multidisciplinary discussion, Other:\nFurther Details of Plan: Pts to undergo CT sim and planning\n\nAdditional Planning\n\nNutrition Assessment: No nutritional assessment\nSmoking Cessation: This patient was referred to the smoking cessation clinic. \nPatient Education: No patient education\n\n\n\n\n",
