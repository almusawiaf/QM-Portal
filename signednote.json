Discussed in detail the risks benefits and logistics of radiation therapy.  Discussed the risks benefits and logistics of ADT. \n\nPatient endorses that he wants to pursue definitive radiation, first ADT was given, will mail Ca/VitD.  CT sim appointment given and patient will return in 6 weeks for radiation simulation, EBRT will begin approx 1 week after. \n\nImpression\n\nImpression: He had been followed with surveillance CT scans which were unremarkable until June 2015, when CT revealed increased size of right paratracheal lymph node (13 mm), precarinal lymph node (15mm x 12mm). PET scan 6/30/2015 revealed new enlarged and intensely FDG avid pretracheal lymph node with an SUV max of 8.6. \nAdditional nonenlarged prevascular FDG avid lymph node with an SUV max of 3.1. Focal 3.2 SUV activity of the right hilum. Interval resolution of hypermetabolic activity within the right lower lobe nodule. Residual scarring demonstrates no FDG uptake. No hypermetabolic pulmonary lesions identified. \n\nMr. Dubord's case was discussed at thoracic tumor board, where the recommendation was made for bronchoscopy with possible EUS. FNA of a 4R (pretracheal) lymph node was positive for malignancy, consistent with adenocarcinoma. \n\nHe returns today for evaluation of radiation therapy in the setting of his recurrent cancer. He states today that he feels well. He has gained 7 lbs since April. His chronic cough has improved after quitting smoking this year, he denies hemoptysis, hematemesis. His lower back pain has improved since his \nspinal surgery last year, he denies any new bone or joint pain, no issues with ambulation.

The rationale as well as risks and benefits of radiation therapy were described to the patient to include short-term side effects of dysuria, urinary urgency, and soft bowel movements and long-term effects of potential loss of erectile function and rectal bleeding.  The patient had all of his questions answered to his satisfaction. He is leaning towards radiation therapy but will take some time to consider his options and will contact us with a decision. We will have the patient return to clinic in 1 month for follow up. We will also have the patient meet with Dr. XXX at the Brooklyn VA to discuss brachytherapy.This patient was seen by Dr. xxxY and myself.  The plan was discussed and developed collaboratively. \n\nImpression\n\nGleason Information\n      Primary: null\n      Secondary: null\n      Grade: 0\n      Positive Cores: null\n      Negative Cores: null\n      \n\nPlan of Care\n\n\nClinical Trial Patient: Yes\nClinical Trial Description: ECOG trial 124\n\nNext Steps\n\n\nAdditional Planning\n\n\n\n\n\n","smokingCessation":"","socialHistory":{"smoking":{"status":"Never","unit":"","description":""},"alcohol":{"status":"No"},"recreationalDrugs":{"history":""},"family":{"include":false,"maritalStatus":"Married","cancerCaseDescription":""},"include":false,"freeText":"The patient stays with his daughter.

Pelvic CT scan revealed a subcm 0.9 cm right external lymph node.\n\nPlan of Care:\nTreatment options and their relevancy in his treatment were discussed including expectant management, radical prostatectomy \n(open, laparoscopic or robotic-assisted), Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy with Image Guidance (IMRT and IGRT), seed implant or a combination of the latter two, as well as the use of androgen blockade therapy with radiation.  These options, including their relevant risks, benefits, and side effects (both acute and long term) were discussed at length today with the patient.\n\nClinical Trial Patient: No\n\nNext Steps: CT simulation and Radiation Treatment planning: [ X ]\n\nFurther Details of Plan: He was clearly not interested in radical surgery.  He would like to proceed with definitive IMRT/IGRT in combination with short course (6 months) hormone therapy.   I would favor repeating the CT pelvis with contrast after 2-3 months of neoadjuvant hormone therapy prior to placement of fiducial markers given the findings on the prior scan.  He will therefore be set up for this treatment in our department.   I have ordered a baseline DEXA scan, Casodex, Eligard, Ca/Vit D and a repeat CT pelvis with contrast in 7/2016.\n\nNutrition Assessment: In addition, dietary concerns, expectations and logistics of radiation therapy were outlined Over 50% of the consultation time, about 60 minutes, was spent counseling the patient.  He had the opportunity to ask questions, all of which were answered to his satisfaction. \n\n\n\n\n","smokingCessation":"","socialHistory":{"smoking":{"status":"Never","unit":"","description":""},"alcohol":{"status":"Yes","drinksPerWeek":{"$numberInt":"1"}},"recreationalDrugs":{"history":""},"family":{"include":false,"maritalStatus":"Married","cancerCaseDescription":""},"include":false,"freeText":""},"stagingDescription":" MICROSCOPIC EXAMINATION and DIAGNOSIS:\n      PROSTATE NEEDLE BIOPSIES, BILATERAL: \n \n      A]PROSTATE RIGHT APEX:MICROFOCUS OF ATYPICAL ACINAR PROLIFERATION, \n        SUSPICIOUS FOR MALIGNANCY. \n \n      B]PROSTATE RIGHT MID: \n \n      - ADENOCARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL, GLEASON'S SCORE 6 (3+3), NO OTHER \n        PATTERN PRESENT, TUMOR APPROXIMATELY INVOLVES 5% OF ENTIRE BIOPSY \n        TISSUE, PRESENT IN 1 OF 2 CORES. \n \n      C]PROSTATE RIGHT BASE: \n \n      - ADENOCARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL, GLEASON'S SCORE 7 (3+4), NO OTHER \n        PATTERN PRESENT, TUMOR APPROXIMATELY INVOLVES 30% OF ENTIRE BIOPSY \n        TISSUE, PRESENT IN 2 OF 2 CORES. \n \n      D]PROSTATE LEFT APEX: \n \n      - ADENOCARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL, GLEASON'S SCORE 7 (3+4), NO OTHER \n        PATTERN PRESENT, TUMOR APPROXIMATELY INVOLVES 30% OF ENTIRE BIOPSY \n        TISSUE, PRESENT IN 2 OF 2 CORES. \n \n      E]PROSTATE LEFT MID: \n \n      - ADENOCARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL, GLEASON'S SCORE 7 (3+4), NO OTHER \n        PATTERN PRESENT, TUMOR APPROXIMATELY INVOLVES 80% OF ENTIRE BIOPSY \n        TISSUE, PRESENT IN 2 OF 2 CORES. \n \n      F]PROSTATE LEFT BASE: \n \n      - ADENOCARCINOMA, CONVENTIONAL, GLEASON'S SCORE 7 (4+3), NO OTHER \n        PATTERN PRESENT, TUMOR APPROXIMATELY INVOLVES 60% OF ENTIRE BIOPSY \n        TISSUE, PRESENT IN 1 OF 2 CORES. \n\nTRUS volume of prostate:\n        The prostate measured 40 cc on trus \n\nCystoscopy at time of prostate biopsies:\n        Urethra was normal sphincter:coapts \n\n        Prostate was mildyl obstructive: small lateral lobes, elevated bladder \n        neck, with intravesical portion. \n\n        Prostatic urethral length 3cm\n\n        Bladder neck was open \n\n        Bladder mucosa:mildly trabeculated\n\n        other findings: NO ulcers inflammation debris\n\n        NO Cellules Diverticuli \n\n        Orifices: appeared to be in the normal orthotopic position only one left \n        ureteral orifice was visualized. right UO poorly seen due to median lobe \n\n        Vascularity:increased with areas of submucosal punctate hemorrhage \n\n        Bladder stones N\n\n        Bladder tumors N\n\n        Foreign bodies N\n \n\nUrine cytology on 3/21/16:\n         DIAGNOSIS:\n      URINE: \n \n      SPECIMEN ADEQUACY: SATISFACTORY SPECIMEN FOR EVALUATION \n \n      CYTOLOGIC DESCRIPTION: FEW SQUAMOUS CELLS, REACTIVE UROTHELIAL CELLS, \n      DEGENERATED UROTHELIAL CELLS \n \n      INTERPRETATION: NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS ","treatmentOptions":{"description":""},"updated":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1647616866948"}},"version":"1.0.0","visitDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1647616866948"}},"vitals":{"bloodPressureSystolic":{"$numberInt":"120"},"bloodPressureDiastolic":{"$numberInt":"75"},"bloodPressureDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1343001600000"}},"heartRate":null,"heartRateDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"temperature":null,"temperatureUnits":"F","temperatureDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"respiratoryRate":null,"respiratoryRateDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"oxygenSaturationPercent":null,"litersOfOxygen":null,"oxygenSaturationDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"0"}},"weight":{"$numberDouble":"221.2"},"weightUnits":"lb","weightDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1343001600000"}},"height":{"$numberInt":"68"},"heightUnits":"in","heightDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1343001600000"}},"updatedDate":{"$date":{"$numberLong":"1647617840699"}}}}

Pelvic CT scan revealed a subcm 0.9 cm right external lymph node.\n\nPlan of Care\n\nClinical Trials\n\nClinical Trial Patient: No\n\nNext Steps\n\nCT simulation and Radiation Treatment planning: [ X ]\nFurther Details of Plan: He was clearly not interested in radical surgery.  He would like to proceed with definitive IMRT/IGRT in combination with short course (6 months) hormone therapy.   I would favor repeating the CT pelvis with contrast after 2-3 months of neoadjuvant hormone therapy prior to placement of fiducial markers given the findings on the prior scan.
